! The very first lines of the main source code file for a game can
! contain compiler options, like the lines above. -~S disables
! strict error checking. This is otherwise used in z5 and z8 games by
! default. While useful for debugging, it adds ~10 KB to the story file
! size and it makes the game slower.
! $OMIT_UNUSED_ROUTINES=1 makes the compiler remove all routines which
! aren't used. This can save some space.
! $ZCODE_LESS_DICT_DATA=1 removes an empty data byte for every dictionary word.
