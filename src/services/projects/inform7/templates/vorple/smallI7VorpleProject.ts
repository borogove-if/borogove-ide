Drawing room is a room. "The drawing room is tastefully decorated."

The serinette is an openable closed container in the drawing room. "A beautiful music box sits on a table." The description is "There's a winding key behind the box."
Understand "music" and "box" as the serinette.

Before examining the serinette:
    place an image "serinette.jpg" with the description "A beautiful music box.", centered.

When play begins:
    preload image "serinette.jpg".

A winding key is part of the serinette.

The serinette can be wound or unwound. The serinette is unwound.

Winding is an action applying to one thing. Understand "wind [something]" as winding.

Check winding when the noun is not the serinette:
    say "That's not something you can wind." instead.

Check winding when the noun is wound:
    say "[The noun] is already wound." instead.

Carry out winding:
    if the serinette is open:
        say "(first closing the serinette)[command clarification break]";
        silently try closing the serinette;
    now the serinette is wound;
    play sound effect "winding.mp3".

Report winding:
    say "You turn the winding key until it turns no more.";

Instead of turning or winding the winding key:
    try winding the serinette.

Instead of inserting something into the serinette:
    say "It's not the kind of box that can contain anything other than its own mechanism."

Carry out opening the serinette when the serinette is wound:
    play music file "musicbox.mp3".

After opening the serinette:
    if the serinette is unwound:
        say "Nothing happens. Looks like it must be wound first.";
    otherwise:
        now the serinette is unwound;
        continue the action.

Carry out closing the serinette:
    stop the music.

Test me with "x serinette / wind serinette / open serinette".
